# This Repo
This repository holds the evolution of IaC on my homelab, and works as an experiment bench.
My final goal is to provide my whole infrastructure as code, there are steps to learn and much code to write until :)

Do not expect best practices in this repository (at least for now): since these are my first steps on IaC, I am following guidelines and documentations the best I can, but my first goal is to provide a working base.

# Orientations
This document will orient usages of Terraform and Ansible
For every application, check a readme inside
